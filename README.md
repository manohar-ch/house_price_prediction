# House-Price-Prediction
This is a regression problem to predict california housing prices.

The dataset contains 20640 entries and 10 variables.
*	Longitude
*	Latitude
*	Housing Median Age
*	Total Rooms
*	Total Bedrooms
*	Population
*	Households
*	Median Income
*	Median House Value
*	Ocean Proximity

**Median House Value is** to be predicted in this problem.

This project contains 2 parts,First part contains data analysis and cleaning as explained in **EDA and data cleaning.ipynb**. Second is training of machine learning models explained in **Training Machine Learning Algorithms.ipynb**.

## 1) Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Cleaning
  Exploratory data analysis and data cleaning
*	Creating new features
*	Removing outliers
*	Transforming skewed features
*	Checking for multicoliniearity

## 2) Training machine learning algorithms:
   I have trained various machine learning algorithms like
*	Linear Regression
*	Ridge RegressioN
*	Support Vector Regression
*	Gradient Boosting Regression
*	Stacking of various models
